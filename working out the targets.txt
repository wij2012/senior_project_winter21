0100
0101
0110
0111
1000
1001
1010
1011

with just the age groups and streaming services, there are 48 possible combinations

rotten tomatoes 0-100%

0-20 horrible
21-40 really bad
41-60 bad/average
61-80 average/good

if ratings are put on the same scale and averaged between 5 possible categories, there are 240 possible combinations

0-10 literally the worst
11-20 horrible
21-30 terrible
31-40 really bad
41-50 bad
51-60 below average
61-70 average
